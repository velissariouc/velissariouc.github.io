It then requests an email account to be licensed. In windows you have to type it, 
while in android you choose it from the accounts we have set on our mobile.

If you are going to run the application on multiple devices and want the data to be synchronized, 
then each device must be uniquely identified by a letter. 
For example, the mobile phone could have the letter 'A' and the desktop computer the letter 'B'. 
The device ID can be changed from the "Settings" - "Data Sync" - "This device" menu (see <a href="data_sync.html">Data Sync</a>)

The application will now create your business and will display the following screen to fill in its name, if it is subject to VAT and if it is a sole proprietorship or a corporation.
